Implementation Plan – Advanced Linux Character Device Driver with Real-Time Monitoring Tool
Phase 1 – Core Driver Setup
Objective: Build the foundation — a working character device driver with basic operations.

Steps:

Module Skeleton

Create a loadable kernel module (.ko) with init and exit functions.

Register a character device using alloc_chrdev_region.

Basic File Operations

Implement open(), read(), write(), release().

Use a fixed-size kernel buffer for data storage.

Module Management

Enable loading (insmod) and unloading (rmmod) with dmesg logging.

Testing

Write a minimal user-space C program to open /dev/mychardev, write data, and read it back.

Phase 2 – Advanced Kernel Features
Objective: Add features that make it feel like a real driver.

Steps:

IOCTL Support

Implement unlocked_ioctl() for custom control commands:

CLEAR_BUFFER

SET_BUFFER_SIZE

ENABLE_LOGGING

Asynchronous I/O

Implement poll() to allow non-blocking reads/writes.

Use wait queues to notify processes when data is available.

Thread-Safety

Protect critical sections with mutex or spinlocks.

Handle concurrent read/write from multiple processes safely.

Statistics Tracking

Keep counters for:

Bytes read

Bytes written

Number of open calls

Procfs / Sysfs Integration

Create /proc/mychardev_stats or /sys/class/mychardev/ to expose stats.

Phase 3 – User-Space Monitoring Tool
Objective: Build a CLI utility to interact with the driver in real time.

Steps:

CLI Commands

Read from the device (read mode).

Write to the device (write mode).

Issue IOCTL commands for configuration.

Live Monitoring

Periodically fetch /proc/mychardev_stats and display:

Read/write rate

Open count

Optional: Use ncurses for a live updating terminal dashboard.

Logging

Save stats to CSV for graph plotting.

Optional: Create Python script to plot usage over time.

Phase 4 – Testing & Validation
Objective: Ensure stability, performance, and correctness.

Steps:

Functional Testing

Verify all file operations.

Test IOCTL commands.

Check asynchronous I/O behavior.

Stress Testing

Use multiple processes reading/writing simultaneously.

Write automated shell scripts to loop write/read operations.

Error Handling

Attempt invalid operations (reading empty buffer, large writes).

Ensure safe handling without kernel crashes (no Oops messages).

Performance Measurement

Measure read/write latency.

Measure CPU usage under high load.

Key Kernel Components:

Initialization: module_init() → registers char device.

Cleanup: module_exit() → unregisters char device.

File Ops Struct: Links open, read, write, release, unlocked_ioctl, poll.

Wait Queues: For async I/O notifications.

Procfs Handler: For stats display.

Testing Workflow
Build the Module

bash
Copy
Edit
make
Insert the Module

bash
