# Kernel---Driver-Linux-Character-Device-Driver-Simulator
This project built a basic Linux character device driver from scratch, exploring low-level OS internals like the Linux kernel module system, user-kernel communication, and device file interfaces. It followed Linux kernel coding standards and used a modular design for reusability and easy extension.
