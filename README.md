# Kernel---Driver-Linux-Character-Device-Driver-Simulator
Overview
This project involved building a basic Linux character device driver from scratch to explore low-level operating system internals, including the Linux kernel module system, user-kernel communication mechanisms, and device file interface. The implementation adhered to Linux kernel coding conventions and used a modular design to make the driver reusable and extendable.

Key Technical Work
1. Driver Development & Core Functionality
Developed a Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) implementing essential character device operations:

open() – Initialize access and prepare device state.

read() – Transfer data from kernel space to user space.

write() – Accept data from user space into kernel buffers.

release() – Close device and release allocated resources.

Used alloc_chrdev_region() to dynamically allocate major and minor numbers, avoiding static conflicts with existing devices.

Registered device operations via struct file_operations for smooth integration with /dev/ entries.

2. Kernel ↔ User Communication
Implemented secure buffer transfers using:

copy_to_user() – Move data from kernel memory to user space safely.

copy_from_user() – Read user-provided data into kernel memory.

Designed a ring buffer mechanism for efficient handling of sequential I/O requests.

3. Module Management & Lifecycle
Used insmod to load and rmmod to remove the module dynamically at runtime.

Verified module state using lsmod and inspected kernel logs with dmesg.

Implemented cleanup routines in module_exit() to avoid memory leaks or dangling pointers.

4. Safety, Synchronization & Debugging
Added spinlocks to ensure thread-safe concurrent access when multiple processes interact with the device.

Implemented error handling for invalid memory access, unexpected I/O requests, and improper device usage.

Used printk() extensively for runtime kernel-level debugging, logging major events and data flow for verification.

5. Testing & Validation
Created user-space C test programs that interact with /dev/<device_name> using standard file I/O functions (fopen, fread, fwrite).

Tested under multiple workloads:

Small and large buffer reads/writes

Concurrent process access

Random access patterns

Verified stability and correctness under different Linux distributions and kernel versions.
